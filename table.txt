Everything I use more than once a day is on my table, so it is easy to imagine how it looks. On the very left side there are two clocks (I need two to wake me up.) Next to the clocks are the books I study from. Half of them are dictionaries, others are physics and management books. Of course, they are completely mixed and to make it harder to get them the left speaker is on the top of the pile. The drawer of the table is always pulled out, I keep the keyboard on it. The monitor is in the very middle making any work on the table impossible. Of course, I exploit the top of the monitor too: the papers I read are on it. Before the display lay the small and indispensable things: razor, vitamins, pens and pencils, calling cards, lighters, floppies, etc. The house of the computer is on the right. Everything is dangling out of it, it has not got a cover. The explorer type people really like my table. They can always find something interesting. My girlfriend is not an explorer type.
